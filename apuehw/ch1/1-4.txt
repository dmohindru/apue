Max value of signed 32 bit integer 2,147,483,647
Since calander time counts number of seconds Since
Epoch 00:00:00 January 1, 1970. So number of maximum 
second a 32 bit integer can count is max value of 
unsigned int which is 2,147,483,647. Converting this value
in number of years
2147483647 / (60*60*24*365) = 68.04

So it will overflow during year 2038. 

We can extent its overflow point by making it 64-bit integer.
Application will need to be recompiled in order to work properly.
More many system would also need to be recompiled in order to work
properly, since many file systems use 32 bit value to store access/modified 
time for media files.
