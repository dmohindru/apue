Since msg to perror is a pointer, perror could modify the string that
msg points to. The qualifier const, however says that perror does not modify
what the pointer points to. On the other had the error number argument to strerror
is an integer, and since C passes all arguments by value the strerror function
couldn't modify this value even if it wanted to.
