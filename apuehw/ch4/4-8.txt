1. du (disk utilized) command works on folder and it slower than df (disk free) command. Moreover when a file in deleted (unlinked)
du command does not shows the deleted file, even though it is being held by a process deleting the file.

2. df command works on partation and read file system meta data to report free disk available, which is faster also. df command will
not show available space when a file is deleted but is being held by a process deleting the file.
