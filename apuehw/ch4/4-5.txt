1. For directory it is not possible to have zero size as any directory in unix type system would
have two entries (expect root directory). 
(.)  current directory
(..) parent directory

2. File is a symbolic link if and only if it points to some other file or directory in system
(weather exits or non exits). So symbolic link must contain some data which point to some other file/directory.
Hence it not possible to have symbolic link of size zero.
