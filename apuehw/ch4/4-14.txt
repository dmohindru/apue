A program can maintain a log file which is updated each time a program is opened.

To check for new mail received, a program can check modification of new mail file with
modification date of log file. All mail file with times newer than log file would be
"new mail"

To check for unread mail, a program can check access time of a mail file with access time
of log file. All mail files with acess times older than log file would be "unread mail since".
